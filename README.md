This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to handling falsy values in functions. The `foo` function aims to add two numbers, but it only explicitly checks for `null` values. This can lead to unexpected results when falsy values like 0, false, or empty strings are passed as arguments. The solution provided addresses this issue by implementing more robust input validation and handling.
